            <p>Objective: The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid.</p>

                <p>Gameplay:
                The game starts with an empty grid.
                Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell of the grid.
                The first player is "X," and the second player is "O."</p>

                <p>Winning:
                A player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row. This can happen horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
                
                <p>Ending the Game:
                The game ends when one of the following happens:
                
                One player gets three of their symbols in a row, and they are declared the winner.
                The entire grid is filled, and the game is declared a draw (a tie).</p>
