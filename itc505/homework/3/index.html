        Explanation 

        Font Selection:
        ->For the headings on the website, the font chosen is "Tilt Prism." This font will be used to make the titles and headings of different sections of the website stand out and have a unique style.
        ->For the paragraphs or body text, the selected font is "Pixelify Sans." This font will be used for the main content and text blocks on the website to ensure readability and consistency.
        Website Creation:
        ->The process began by creating a sample food website. This website is likely to have various sections or tabs, such as "Home," "Menu," "About Us," and "Contact." Each of these tabs will contain specific content related to the respective section's topic.
        Font Specification:
        ->To apply the chosen fonts to the website's design, the "Tilt Prism" font will be used for all the headings or titles within the website. This choice will give the headings a distinct and eye-catching appearance, contributing to the website's visual appeal.
        ->On the other hand, "Pixelify Sans" will be applied to paragraphs and other textual content. This font choice is made with readability and consistency in mind, ensuring that the main body of text is clear and easy to read.
        Font Resources:
        ->To implement these fonts, the designer references Google Fonts, a service provided by Google that offers a wide selection of web fonts for use in website design. The specific URL mentioned, "https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started," is likely used as a guide to learn how to integrate Google Fonts into the website effectively.

        The explanation outlines the process of selecting fonts ("Tilt Prism" for headings and "Pixelify Sans" for paragraphs) and specifies their application in the context of a sample food website. The fonts are chosen to enhance the website's aesthetics and readability, and Google Fonts is used as a resource to help implement these font choices effectively.
