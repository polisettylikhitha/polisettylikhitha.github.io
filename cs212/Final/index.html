        <p>
            As an ITC student tasked with developing the "Lights Out" game, 
            my journey was both challenging and enlightening. The first step was conceptualizing 
            the game design, focusing on user engagement and intuitive gameplay. I chose a simple 
            yet elegant design with a dynamic grid interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the significant challenges I faced was implementing the logic for toggling 
            neighboring cells. This required careful consideration of edge cases, particularly 
            at the grid's borders. I overcame this by carefully calculating the indices of the 
            neighboring cells and ensuring they were within the grid's bounds before toggling them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another hurdle was managing the game's state, particularly the timer and click counter. 
            Using JavaScript's setInterval and clearInterval functions, I was able to create a 
            real-time timer that accurately reflected the game's progress. Handling the maximum 
            number of clicks added an extra layer of complexity, but it also introduced a strategic 
            element to the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this process, I gained valuable insights into the importance of clean and 
            maintainable code, especially when dealing with complex game logic. I learned the 
            significance of thoroughly testing each feature to ensure a bug-free user experience. 
            Overall, this project has been a tremendous learning opportunity, enhancing my problem-solving 
            skills and understanding of interactive web development.
